# Binge Watch Time

Binge Watch Time (BWT) is a TV show tracker developed for my personal use as a hobby project after not being satisfied with the existing apps that I've been using in the past. It consists of a Node.js server, MySQL DB and a React front-end. [themoviedb.org](themoviedb.org) is used for shows data.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). The most recent version of CRA's guide can be found [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Getting started
If you want to run your own instance or create a PR, you will need to run this project. While `package.json`'s `scripts` object should be self-explanatory, `do-deploy.sh` script will also give you an idea on the deployment process.

## Todo
This project is a work in progress and I would like to have:
- notifications
- better email templates
- movie support
- user settings such a spoiler alerts
- ...
